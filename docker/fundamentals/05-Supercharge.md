# Using Docker to Supercharge Automation

## Executing simple admin tasks in a container

Let's assume you need to strip all leading whitespaces from a file and you found the following handy Perl script to do exactly that:  

> `cat sample.txt | perl -lpe 's/^\s*//'`  

As it turns out, you don't have Perl installed on your working machine. What can you do except install Perl on the machine? Can't we use Docker to circumvent the need to install Perl? Yes, we can.  

```sh
# create a folder
mkdir -p ~/fod/simple && cd ~/fod/simple

# open VS Code from within this folder:
code .

# In this folder, create a `sample.txt` file with  the following content:
1234567890
  This is some text
    another line of text
 more text
        final line

# run a container with Perl installed in it. 
docker container run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
-w /usr/src/app perl:slim sh -c \
"cat sample.txt | perl -lpe 's/^\s*//'"

# The output generated by the preceding command should look like this:
1234567890
This is some text
another line of text
more text
final line
```

## Using test containers

Unit tests assert the correctness and quality of an individual, isolated piece of the overall application or application service. Integration tests make sure that pieces that are closely related work together as expected. Stress and load tests often take the application or service as a whole and assert a correct behavior under various edge cases such as high load through multiple concurrent requests handled by the service, or by flooding the service with a huge amount of data. Finally, end-to-end tests simulate a real user working with the application or application service. The typical tasks that a user would do are automated.  

The code or component under test is often called a **System Under test (SUT)**.
